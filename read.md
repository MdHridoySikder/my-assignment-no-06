 1. Difference between var, let, and const:
var is the old way to declare variables. It can be redeclared and changed anytime, and it works in the whole function. let is newer and works only inside the block where it’s declared. It can be changed but not redeclared in the same block. const is also block-scoped, but its value cannot be changed after declaring.

2. Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter():
map is used to create a new array after changing each element. forEach is used just to loop through an array but it doesn’t return a new one. filter is used to make a new array that only includes the elements that match a certain condition.

3. Arrow functions in ES6:
Arrow functions are a shorter and easier way to write functions. They make code look clean and are often used when we don’t need complex logic. They also automatically use the same “this” as the outer scope.

4. Destructuring assignment in ES6:
Destructuring helps us take specific values from arrays or objects and store them directly in variables. It makes the code shorter and easier to read instead of writing long property access.

5. Template literals in ES6 and how they are different from string concatenation:
Template literals use backticks (`) instead of normal quotes. They allow putting variables directly inside the string using ${}. They also support writing strings in multiple lines easily. This makes them cleaner and simpler than using + to join strings.
